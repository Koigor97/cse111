This week was centered on improving our programming skills with efficiency in mind.
We were taught how to test the functions in our Python programs. By so doing, it helps us
as developers to indentify bugs in our code and fix them. To this however, it is recommended
to create a separate Python file for testing the functions. This makes it easy and less clustered
in our code.

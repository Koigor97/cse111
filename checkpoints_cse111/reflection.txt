Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    For me, that would be week-4 chemistry.py program. Although I only wrote 2 or 3 functions
    if I could remember, but looking at the other functions written by you guys and seeing
    how intricate and denzed it was, all completing a certain task and returning the computed
    values, made me realize the power of functions.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    Test functions are really important to give you an added assurance to that the functions
    in your programs work as they should. And if there's any bugs in your functions, it points
    it out and gives you hints as to where the bug is coming from. You as the programmer, can
    then make the needed rectifications.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    I have various ways in approaching a problem. First I'll try to think like a computer and
    work the process in my head step by step as the computer would have done it. Secondly, I
    look carefully in the code for any syntax error or misspellings. Thirdly, I use the print -
    statement in the block of code where I think the issue is coming from. Fourthly, I read the
    error message that is printed in the console and try to traceback as to where the bug is
    located. The fifth way is to use the debugger and step line by line in my program and see
    how everything executes. Sixth would be Stackoverflow , Google and YouTube.
